#### [GOTO 2017 • The Many Meanings of Event-Driven Architecture • Martin Fowler - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0)
_<sup>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0</sup>_

During my career, I've often people heard people describe their systems as "event-driven". But when looking deeper that phrase seems to lead to some very different architectural assumptions. On a rece...
